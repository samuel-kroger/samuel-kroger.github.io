## Teaching Experience

I am very passionate about teaching.
During my second year at Rice I started pursuing a [certificate in teaching and learning](https://cte.rice.edu/grads), a four course certificate program at Rice University's Center for Teaching Excellence.

At Rice I have had the following teaching responsibility:

- Teacher’s Assistant, CAAM 334, Matrix Analysis Data Science Spring 2020
- Grader, CAAM 335, Matrix Analysis Fall 2020
- Grader, CAAM 382, Stochastic Models Spring 2019
- Grader, CAAM 335, Matrix Analysis Fall 2019

At my time at Bates I was a TA for multivariable calculus and was a tutor at [the Mathematics and Statistics Workshop](https://www.bates.edu/math-stat-workshop/).
