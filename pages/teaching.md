At Rice I have had the following teaching responsibility:
- Instructor of Record, CAAM 334, Matrix Analysis for Data Science Summer 2023
- Teacher's Assistant, CAAM 334, Matrix Analysis for Data Science Spring 2023
- Grader, CAAM 335, Matrix Analysis Fall 2022
- Grader, CAAM 570, Graph Theory Spring 2022
- Teacher’s Assistant, CAAM 335, Matrix Analysis Fall 2021
- Teacher’s Assistant, CAAM 334, Matrix Analysis for Data Science Spring 2021
- Grader, CAAM 335, Matrix Analysis Fall 2020
- Grader, CAAM 382, Stochastic Models Spring 2020
- Grader, CAAM 335, Matrix Analysis Fall 2019

At my time at Bates I was a TA for multivariable calculus and was a tutor at [the Mathematics and Statistics Workshop](https://www.bates.edu/math-stat-workshop/).
