My name is Samuel Kroger, I was born and raised in Houston Texas.
In 2016 I began pursuing a bachlors of arts at Bates College.
While at Bates I worked on three research projects.

1. Research for Blake Sturtevant, PhD, Professor of Physics, Bates College, 2017 - I applied various polynomial fitting routines in Python, MATLAB, and R to large data sets
	collected from the Los Alamos National Lab.

2. Research for Raj Saha, PhD, MS, Professor of Physics, Bates College 2017 â€“ 2018 - I downloaded data from the Global Terrestrial Network for Permafrost (GTN-P) to create models of how heat transfers between different depths of permafrost using partial differential equations.

3. Research for Tradesmith Capital, hedge fund - I created a package in R that normalizes and downloads data from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Lewis to a SQL database. It is currently being implemented to update thousands of economic time series data within Tradesmith Capital. I also created a feature in Python that uses the Fourier transform to reveal cyclic patterns in time series data.

After I graduated from Bates College in 2019, I began a PhD at Rice University in the department of Computational applied Mathematics and Operations Research.
My advisor is doctor [Illya V. Hicks](https://www.caam.rice.edu/~ivhicks/Site/professional.html).
After passing my qualifying exams(It took me a second attempt) I began work on my first research project: The Anchored k-core problem.
At the time LOGAN SMITH, a member of Dr. Hicks's research group shared with me THIS PAPER.
I started using Integer Programming (IP) to solve the anchored k-core problem alongside mentor and post doc of Dr.Hicks research group Hamidreza Validi.
Around the same time Hamid introduced me to the Majority-Minority districting problem and we began work on that.
In March of 2022 I defended my masters thesis on the maximum anchored k-core problem.
In July 2022, I submitted my first paper [Maximizing resilience in large-scale social networks](http://www.optimization-online.org/DB_FILE/2022/07/8993.pdf).
Currently I am working on submitting a paper on applying benders decomposition to the Majority-Minority districting problem.
