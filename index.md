My name is Samuel Kroger, I am a fourth year PhD student at the department of Computational applied Mathematics and Operations Research (CMOR) at Rice University.
I received my MA of Computational applied Mathematics and Operations research from Rice University in 2022 and a BA of Mathematics from Bates college in 2019.
I am interested in the intersection of mixed integer programming, graph theory and combinatorics.
